Description: learn the piano just by playing a game
 Piano Booster is a new way to learn the piano just by playing a game.
 It takes elements of the game Guitar Hero but now it uses a real piano
 keyboard and the game has been turned sideways so the notes scroll along
 a musical stave. So instead of pressing buttons on a fake guitar you end
 up learning to play a real musical instrument: the piano.
 .
 To run Piano Booster you need a MIDI Piano Keyboard and a MIDI interface
 for the PC. If you don't have a MIDI keyboard you can still try out
 PianoBooster, using the PC keyboard ('x' is middle C), but a MIDI piano
 is really recommended).
